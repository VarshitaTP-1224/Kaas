# Product Requirements Document (PRD): AccQT
Devil's dictionary:
To beg: To ask for something with an earnestness proportioned to the belief that it will not be given.

## 0 A THOUGHT
In my office, the act of paying a salary each week might seem like a simple, one-way transaction: I give my employees money for the work they’ve done. But when I look more closely, I realize this is just one part of a much deeper cycle. The money I pay doesn’t just disappear—it’s part of a larger, interconnected system that reflects the Indian concept of *krama* (cause) and *karma* (effect).

I pay my employees at the end of each week, but that’s just the beginning of the process. The work they do creates something—whether it’s a product or a service—that goes out into the world. This product, in turn, generates income for me. Sometimes the return is immediate, and other times it’s delayed or even intangible. But whatever form it takes, the effort they’ve put in flows back to me, closing the loop.

In this transaction, I see three invisible factors at play: priority, timing, and assets. The first, priority, represents my decisions about which expenses to pay first. I have P0 for the most urgent expenses, P1 for those I can delay slightly, and P2 for those I can put off until later. These decisions shape the flow of resources in my company, influencing what happens next.

Then there’s timing. Not everything needs to be paid immediately. T0 represents those things that require urgent attention, while T1 and T2 are things I can defer to a later date. The way I manage time in this system reflects how I balance short-term needs with long-term goals.

Lastly, there are the assets I generate from this cycle. A0 represents immediate returns—things like cash or fixed assets. A1 is more about regular, predictable returns, like monthly income or recurring revenue. A2, the intangible assets, are the things that are harder to measure but no less important—brand value, reputation, relationships.

When I step back and look at this entire system, I see how every decision I make is a cause (*krama*) that leads to an effect (*karma*). The money I pay sets off a chain of actions, and those actions come back to me, sometimes in ways I didn’t expect. Some weeks, the effect of that cause is immediate—a quick sale, cash in hand. Other times, the effect is delayed or more subtle—an intangible benefit that shows up later in the form of growth or goodwill.

What I’ve come to realize is that this system isn’t just about transactions. It’s about understanding the balance between effort and return, action and reaction. Every choice I make—how I prioritize payments, how I manage time, and how I generate assets—ripples through the system, influencing everything else. It’s a constant cycle of cause and effect, just like in the philosophy of karma. Every action has a consequence, and every consequence becomes the starting point for the next action. This keeps my business moving forward in a dynamic, ever-evolving process.

Insights from excel:
The "Freedom (Future)" and "Transactions (Past)" sheets provide detailed financial records related to your company’s transactions. Here’s a thoughtful analysis and correlation between these sheets and the strategy from the earlier philosophical summary:

Freedom (Future) Insights:
This sheet seems to forecast payments and obligations for future dates. For example:

Salaries are listed for specific individuals, with corresponding amounts, departments, and comments about weekly payments (e.g., Week 39 Payable).
Payments are associated with modes like "ICICI Current" and categorized under "Salaries."
The "Priority" column appears empty, but it could represent the urgency of payments (T0, T1, T2), aligning with your time factors for prioritizing expenses.
This sheet reflects how krama (the cause) unfolds: each payment listed here is a commitment that leads to a future outcome (the work that employees perform in return). It's essential to assign priorities here based on your T0 (urgent), T1 (deferrable), and T2 (long-term) strategy to effectively manage cash flow.

Transactions (Past) Insights:
This sheet records payments that have already been made, such as loans (EMIs) and insurance payments:

These entries show past transactions categorized under EMI, Maintenance, and other recurring obligations.
Each entry details the date, department, and comments about the nature of the payment (e.g., "Paid EMI for July Month").
This represents the karma—the effects of past actions. These payments reflect obligations that have come due from earlier financial decisions, illustrating how the balance of priorities, timing, and asset generation (P, T, A) affects your business’s current state. It’s important to analyze these transactions to understand how past priorities have affected current cash flow and asset growth.

Strategic Correlation:
Prioritize Payments (P):

In both sheets, expenses such as salaries, EMIs, and maintenance are present. Assign a priority (P0 for urgent, P1 for deferrable, P2 for long-term) to each expense. Future obligations in the Freedom (Future) sheet should be organized this way so you can manage cash flow based on urgency.
Time Factor (T):

For both sheets, create a system to tag expenses with T0 (immediate), T1 (deferred), and T2 (long-term). This will allow you to strategize which payments need to be made now (like salary or EMIs) and which can be delayed (like maintenance or non-essential expenses).
Assets (A):

In your summary, you categorized assets into A0 (immediate), A1 (monthly), and A2 (intangible). Reviewing the Transactions (Past) sheet can help you map which past actions led to which type of return. Salaries paid may have led to immediate product creation (A0), while maintenance and EMIs might contribute to longer-term or intangible benefits (A2).
Feedback Loop (Krama and Karma):

As in your philosophical model, each past action (from Transactions Past) feeds into a future cause (Freedom Future). By studying which actions led to the most favorable returns (whether financial or intangible), you can prioritize future expenses that are likely to yield similar benefits.
Suggested Next Steps:
Fill in Priorities: In the "Freedom (Future)" sheet, populate the "Priority" column based on the urgency of each expense.

Cash Flow Simulation: Use these two sheets to simulate future cash flow. Look at past expenses that were high-priority but didn’t yield significant returns, and adjust future priorities accordingly.

Asset Mapping: Link each past transaction to the type of asset it produced. This can help you focus on which payments in the future are likely to generate the best returns for your company.

4. Implementation and Deployment:

4.1 Admin Insights:

4.1.2 Transactions past:
To effectively quantify how past transactions have contributed to the generation of assets (A0, A1, A2), it's essential to analyze and categorize each transaction based on its impact. Here's a detailed step-by-step outline for creating a strategy to assign asset values to your past transactions:

1. Define Asset Categories Clearly:
A0 (Immediate Assets): These are assets or returns that directly influence your cash flow in the short term. Examples include sales revenue, quick customer payments, or income generated from selling a product or service immediately.

A1 (Monthly or Regular Assets): These are assets that provide ongoing returns. For instance, recurring revenue from contracts, monthly rental income, or subscription payments.

A2 (Intangible Assets): These are more abstract but still valuable assets, such as improvements in brand reputation, customer goodwill, long-term relationships, or skills development that may result in future business opportunities.

2. Categorize Past Transactions Based on Asset Generation:
Step 1: Review Transactions (Past)
Examine each entry in the "Transactions (Past)" sheet and break it down according to its category (e.g., EMI, Maintenance, Salaries). For each transaction, ask:

Did this transaction result in an immediate return or generate cash flow quickly (A0)?
Does it contribute to ongoing revenue streams, like recurring payments or contracts (A1)?
Does it enhance the company's long-term value, indirectly contributing to future returns (A2)?
Step 2: Create Asset Tags for Each Transaction
Once you’ve reviewed the transaction, tag it with its corresponding asset category:

A0 for Immediate Returns: For transactions that led to direct revenue (like sales payments, service fees, or immediate project completions).
A1 for Monthly/Regular Returns: For transactions related to recurring income (like subscription services, ongoing contracts, or regular maintenance that supports long-term operations).
A2 for Intangible Benefits: For investments in marketing, employee training, or customer relations that may not yield immediate returns but enhance the brand or customer loyalty over time.
3. Assign Quantitative Value to Assets:
Step 1: Quantify Immediate (A0) and Recurring (A1) Assets
A0 (Immediate Income): For transactions that led to immediate cash inflows, assign the actual cash received. If a salary payment resulted in a direct sale that brought in revenue, associate that sale amount with the salary transaction.

Example: Paying a salesperson $500 might result in $2,000 of sales in the same week. The A0 value for the salary would then be $2,000.
A1 (Monthly or Regular Income): For recurring income, estimate the monthly contribution of that transaction to cash flow.

Example: A maintenance payment for a piece of equipment might result in it being operational for the next 6 months, generating $500 in revenue each month. You would then assign $500 per month as the A1 value for the transaction.
Step 2: Estimate Intangible (A2) Assets
A2 (Intangible Value): For intangible assets, it’s harder to assign a direct monetary value, but you can estimate based on its long-term potential. For example, a marketing campaign may result in increased brand awareness, which could indirectly lead to more sales down the line. Use metrics like customer retention rates, brand growth, or new customer acquisition to assign a relative value.
Example: A $1,000 marketing campaign that results in a 5% increase in customer retention could be valued as A2, using future sales projections to estimate how much revenue those retained customers will generate.
4. Develop an Asset Impact Score for Each Transaction:
Create a simple scoring system (1-10) to measure how impactful a particular transaction was in generating assets:

Impact on A0 (Immediate Cash Flow): Did this transaction directly result in immediate cash flow? Score higher (8-10) for transactions that led to direct income.
Impact on A1 (Recurring Revenue): Does the transaction create regular income streams over time? Score moderately high (6-8) for expenses that contribute to steady revenue.
Impact on A2 (Intangibles): Does the transaction build long-term intangible value for the company? Score based on the estimated future impact (4-6) for brand-building or customer retention-related transactions.
Use this score to quickly assess which transactions have the highest return potential.

5. Link Past Transactions to Future Forecasting:
Step 1: Create a Forecasting Model
Using the asset tags and scores, build a forecasting model that shows how future transactions can be optimized based on past results. Analyze which types of payments (salaries, EMIs, maintenance) resulted in the most asset generation and plan future cash flow accordingly.

Step 2: Adjust Priority Based on Asset Generation
Adjust future payment priorities based on the asset value each transaction generated:

Payments that contributed significantly to immediate or recurring revenue (A0 and A1) should be given higher priority (P0 or P1).
Payments that contribute to intangible benefits (A2) should be made when liquidity is higher but can be deferred (P2) during tight cash flow periods.
6. Automate the Process:
Step 1: Set Up an Excel-Based System
You can create an Excel spreadsheet that automatically tags and scores each transaction based on its asset category:

Set up formulas that automatically calculate the asset value based on the amount of the transaction and its estimated return (A0, A1, or A2).
Use conditional formatting to highlight high-impact transactions, allowing you to focus on optimizing these payments.
Step 2: Dashboard for Insights
Build a dashboard that visualizes the balance between cash inflows and outflows. Include metrics like:

Total A0, A1, and A2 assets generated over a period.
A comparison of how much cash is going into generating immediate returns versus long-term value.
This will give you a clear overview of which areas of spending are most effective in creating value for your business.

7. Reevaluate Periodically:
Make it a practice to review your transactions regularly (monthly or quarterly) and adjust the asset categorization and impact scores based on actual performance:

If a transaction initially categorized as A2 starts yielding returns sooner, reclassify it to A0 or A1.
Revisit transactions that scored low on impact and reevaluate their necessity in future budgets.
Conclusion:
This strategy will help you analyze how past transactions have contributed to your company's assets, both immediate and long-term. By quantifying the effects of each payment, you can optimize your future spending to focus on transactions that generate the most value, ensuring that your cash flow is directed toward high-impact areas of your business. 

4.2 Coding Strategy:
Implementing a robust two-way matching mechanism to reconcile your Excel records with data from Zoho Books API, ICICI Current Account bank feeds, credit card PDF statements, and cash registry entries is a multi-step process.

---

## **2. Detailed Implementation Steps**

### **Step 1: Setting Up the Environment**

1. **Install Required Python Packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install xlwings pandas requests pdfplumber openpyxl
   ```

2. **Set Up Excel Workbook**:
   - Ensure your Excel workbook has separate sheets for different data sources (e.g., `Freedom(Future)`, `Transactions(Past)`, etc.).
   - Define a dedicated sheet for reconciliation (e.g., `Reconciliation`).

### **Step 2: Fetching Data from Zoho Books API**

1. **Obtain Zoho Books API Credentials**:
   - Register for Zoho Books API access and obtain the necessary API keys and tokens.

2. **Fetch Bank Transactions via Zoho Books API**:
   ```python
   import requests
   import pandas as pd

   def fetch_zoho_books_transactions(auth_token, organization_id):
       url = f"https://books.zoho.com/api/v3/transactions?organization_id={organization_id}"
       headers = {
           'Authorization': f'Zoho-authtoken {auth_token}',
           'X-com-zoho-books-organizationid': organization_id
       }
       response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
       if response.status_code == 200:
           data = response.json()
           transactions = data.get('transactions', [])
           return pd.DataFrame(transactions)
       else:
           raise Exception(f"Error fetching data: {response.status_code}, {response.text}")

   # Example usage
   auth_token = 'your_auth_token'
   organization_id = 'your_org_id'
   zoho_transactions_df = fetch_zoho_books_transactions(auth_token, organization_id)
   ```

### **Step 3: Parsing Credit Card PDF Statements**

1. **Extract Data from PDFs Using `pdfplumber`**:
   ```python
   import pdfplumber

   def parse_credit_card_pdf(pdf_path):
       transactions = []
       with pdfplumber.open(pdf_path) as pdf:
           for page in pdf.pages:
               text = page.extract_table()
               if text:
                   for row in text[1:]:  # Skip header row
                       transaction = {
                           'Date': row[0],
                           'Description': row[1],
                           'Amount': row[2],
                           'Category': row[3]
                       }
                       transactions.append(transaction)
       return pd.DataFrame(transactions)

   # Example usage
   credit_card_pdf_path = 'path_to_credit_card_statement.pdf'
   credit_card_df = parse_credit_card_pdf(credit_card_pdf_path)
   ```

### **Step 4: Extracting Cash Registry Entries**

1. **Assuming Cash Entries are in Excel or Another Structured Format**:
   ```python
   def load_cash_registry(excel_path, sheet_name='CashRegistry'):
       cash_registry_df = pd.read_excel(excel_path, sheet_name=sheet_name)
       return cash_registry_df

   # Example usage
   excel_path = 'path_to_your_excel_file.xlsx'
   cash_registry_df = load_cash_registry(excel_path)
   ```

### **Step 5: Reading Existing Excel Sheets**

1. **Use `xlwings` to Read and Write Excel Data**:
   ```python
   import xlwings as xw

   def read_excel_sheet(workbook_path, sheet_name):
       wb = xw.Book(workbook_path)
       sheet = wb.sheets[sheet_name]
       data = sheet.range('A1').options(pd.DataFrame, expand='table').value
       wb.close()
       return data

   # Example usage
   transactions_past_df = read_excel_sheet(excel_path, 'Transactions(Past)')
   freedom_future_df = read_excel_sheet(excel_path, 'Freedom(Future)')
   ```

### **Step 6: Data Standardization**

1. **Ensure Consistent Date Formats and Column Names**:
   ```python
   def standardize_dates(df, date_column):
       df[date_column] = pd.to_datetime(df[date_column], dayfirst=True)
       return df

   # Apply to all dataframes
   zoho_transactions_df = standardize_dates(zoho_transactions_df, 'Date')
   credit_card_df = standardize_dates(credit_card_df, 'Date')
   cash_registry_df = standardize_dates(cash_registry_df, 'Date')
   transactions_past_df = standardize_dates(transactions_past_df, 'Date')
   freedom_future_df = standardize_dates(freedom_future_df, 'Date')
   ```

2. **Normalize Column Names Across Dataframes**:
   ```python
   def normalize_columns(df):
       df.columns = [col.strip().lower().replace(' ', '_') for col in df.columns]
       return df

   # Apply to all dataframes
   zoho_transactions_df = normalize_columns(zoho_transactions_df)
   credit_card_df = normalize_columns(credit_card_df)
   cash_registry_df = normalize_columns(cash_registry_df)
   transactions_past_df = normalize_columns(transactions_past_df)
   freedom_future_df = normalize_columns(freedom_future_df)
   ```

### **Step 7: Implementing the Two-Way Matching Mechanism**

1. **Define Matching Criteria**:
   - **Exact Match**: Transactions with the same date, amount, and description.
   - **Partial Match**: Transactions with similar amounts and descriptions but different dates (use fuzzy matching if necessary).

2. **Perform Matching**:
   ```python
   from difflib import SequenceMatcher

   def similar(a, b):
       return SequenceMatcher(None, a, b).ratio()

   def match_transactions(excel_df, api_df, threshold=0.8):
       matches = []
       unmatched_excel = excel_df.copy()
       unmatched_api = api_df.copy()

       for idx, excel_row in excel_df.iterrows():
           for api_idx, api_row in api_df.iterrows():
               if (excel_row['amount'] == api_row['amount']) and (similar(str(excel_row['description']), str(api_row['description'])) > threshold):
                   matches.append((idx, api_idx))
                   unmatched_excel.drop(idx, inplace=True)
                   unmatched_api.drop(api_idx, inplace=True)
                   break

       return matches, unmatched_excel, unmatched_api

   # Example usage
   matches, unmatched_excel, unmatched_api = match_transactions(transactions_past_df, zoho_transactions_df)
   ```

3. **Automate Matching for All Data Sources**:
   ```python
   # Combine all external data sources into one DataFrame
   external_df = pd.concat([zoho_transactions_df, credit_card_df, cash_registry_df], ignore_index=True)

   # Perform matching with Transactions (Past)
   matches, unmatched_transactions, unmatched_external = match_transactions(transactions_past_df, external_df)
   ```

### **Step 8: Validating and Cleaning Data**

1. **Identify and Resolve Discrepancies**:
   - **Unmatched Transactions**: Investigate why certain transactions didn’t match. Check for data entry errors, missing information, or timing differences.
   - **Duplicate Entries**: Ensure there are no duplicate transactions in either dataset.
   - **Categorization Errors**: Verify that transactions are categorized correctly and adjust categories if necessary.

2. **Implement Validation Rules**:
   ```python
   def validate_transactions(df):
       # Example validation rules
       df['amount_valid'] = df['amount'] > 0
       df['date_valid'] = df['date'].notnull()
       df['description_valid'] = df['description'].notnull()
       return df[df['amount_valid'] & df['date_valid'] & df['description_valid']]

   # Apply validation
   transactions_past_df = validate_transactions(transactions_past_df)
   external_df = validate_transactions(external_df)
   ```

### **Step 9: Updating Excel Sheets with xlwings**

1. **Write Matched and Unmatched Data Back to Excel**:
   ```python
   def write_to_excel(workbook_path, sheet_name, df):
       wb = xw.Book(workbook_path)
       sheet = wb.sheets[sheet_name]
       sheet.clear_contents()
       sheet.range('A1').value = df
       wb.save()
       wb.close()

   # Example usage
   write_to_excel(excel_path, 'Reconciliation_Matches', transactions_past_df.loc[matches[0]])
   write_to_excel(excel_path, 'Reconciliation_Unmatched_Transactions', unmatched_transactions)
   write_to_excel(excel_path, 'Reconciliation_Unmatched_External', unmatched_external)
   ```

### **Step 10: Automating the Process**

1. **Create a Python Script to Run the Entire Workflow**:
   ```python
   def reconcile_accounts(excel_path, zoho_auth_token, organization_id, credit_card_pdf_path):
       # Step 2: Fetch Zoho Books transactions
       zoho_df = fetch_zoho_books_transactions(zoho_auth_token, organization_id)

       # Step 3: Parse credit card PDF
       credit_card_df = parse_credit_card_pdf(credit_card_pdf_path)

       # Step 4: Load cash registry
       cash_registry_df = load_cash_registry(excel_path)

       # Step 5: Read existing Excel sheets
       transactions_past_df = read_excel_sheet(excel_path, 'Transactions(Past)')
       freedom_future_df = read_excel_sheet(excel_path, 'Freedom(Future)')

       # Step 6: Standardize data
       for df in [zoho_df, credit_card_df, cash_registry_df, transactions_past_df, freedom_future_df]:
           df = standardize_dates(df, 'date')
           df = normalize_columns(df)

       # Step 7: Match transactions
       external_df = pd.concat([zoho_df, credit_card_df, cash_registry_df], ignore_index=True)
       matches, unmatched_transactions, unmatched_external = match_transactions(transactions_past_df, external_df)

       # Step 8: Validate data
       transactions_past_df = validate_transactions(transactions_past_df)
       external_df = validate_transactions(external_df)

       # Step 9: Update Excel
       write_to_excel(excel_path, 'Reconciliation_Matches', transactions_past_df.loc[matches[0]])
       write_to_excel(excel_path, 'Reconciliation_Unmatched_Transactions', unmatched_transactions)
       write_to_excel(excel_path, 'Reconciliation_Unmatched_External', unmatched_external)

       print("Reconciliation complete.")

   # Run the reconciliation
   reconcile_accounts('path_to_your_excel_file.xlsx', 'your_auth_token', 'your_org_id', 'path_to_credit_card_statement.pdf')
   ```

2. **Schedule the Script to Run Daily**:
   - Use task schedulers like **Windows Task Scheduler** or **cron** on Unix-based systems to run the script at a specified time each day.

### **Step 11: Implementing Bookkeeping Techniques for Daily Reliability**

1. **Daily Transaction Entry**:
   - Ensure that all transactions are entered into their respective sources daily (Excel, Zoho Books, etc.).
   
2. **Daily Reconciliation**:
   - Run the reconciliation script daily to ensure that all transactions are matched and discrepancies are identified immediately.
   
3. **Review Unmatched Transactions**:
   - At the end of each day, review the `Reconciliation_Unmatched_Transactions` and `Reconciliation_Unmatched_External` sheets to resolve any issues.
   
4. **Maintain Accurate Categories**:
   - Regularly update and verify the categorization of transactions (P, T, A) to reflect their true impact on your business.

### **Step 12: Validation Techniques to Keep Books Clean**

1. **Double-Entry Accounting**:
   - Implement a double-entry system where every transaction affects at least two accounts (debits and credits), ensuring the books balance.

2. **Automated Validation Rules**:
   - Implement rules within your Python script to check for:
     - Duplicate transactions.
     - Transactions without corresponding entries.
     - Unusual amounts that deviate significantly from typical transactions.
   
3. **Regular Audits**:
   - Conduct regular internal audits to manually verify the accuracy of reconciled data.
   
4. **Exception Reporting**:
   - Generate reports highlighting discrepancies, unmatched transactions, and potential errors for review and correction.

5. **Consistent Documentation**:
   - Maintain detailed documentation for all transactions, including descriptions and categories, to facilitate easier matching and auditing.

import pandas as pd
import requests
import pdfplumber
from difflib import SequenceMatcher

# Define helper functions as described in the steps above
# ...

def write_to_excel(workbook_path, sheet_name, df):
    with xw.App(visible=False) as app:
        wb = app.books.open(workbook_path)
        sheet = wb.sheets[sheet_name]
        sheet.clear_contents()
        sheet.range('A1').value = df
        wb.save()
        wb.close()

def reconcile_accounts(excel_path, zoho_auth_token, organization_id, credit_card_pdf_path):
    # Fetch Zoho Books transactions
    zoho_df = fetch_zoho_books_transactions(zoho_auth_token, organization_id)
    
    # Parse credit card PDF
    credit_card_df = parse_credit_card_pdf(credit_card_pdf_path)
    
    # Load cash registry
    cash_registry_df = load_cash_registry(excel_path)
    
    # Read existing Excel sheets
    transactions_past_df = read_excel_sheet(excel_path, 'Transactions(Past)')
    freedom_future_df = read_excel_sheet(excel_path, 'Freedom(Future)')
    
    # Standardize data
    for df in [zoho_df, credit_card_df, cash_registry_df, transactions_past_df, freedom_future_df]:
        df = standardize_dates(df, 'date')
        df = normalize_columns(df)
    
    # Match transactions
    external_df = pd.concat([zoho_df, credit_card_df, cash_registry_df], ignore_index=True)
    matches, unmatched_transactions, unmatched_external = match_transactions(transactions_past_df, external_df)
    
    # Validate data
    transactions_past_df = validate_transactions(transactions_past_df)
    external_df = validate_transactions(external_df)
    
    # Update Excel
    write_to_excel(excel_path, 'Reconciliation_Matches', transactions_past_df.loc[matches[0]])
    write_to_excel(excel_path, 'Reconciliation_Unmatched_Transactions', unmatched_transactions)
    write_to_excel(excel_path, 'Reconciliation_Unmatched_External', unmatched_external)
    
    print("Reconciliation complete.")

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    excel_path = 'path_to_your_excel_file.xlsx'
    zoho_auth_token = 'your_auth_token'
    organization_id = 'your_org_id'
    credit_card_pdf_path = 'path_to_credit_card_statement.pdf'
    
    reconcile_accounts(excel_path, zoho_auth_token, organization_id, credit_card_pdf_path)
```

## **5. Advanced Matching and Reconciliation Techniques**

1. **Fuzzy Matching for Descriptions**:
   - Implement fuzzy matching using libraries like `fuzzywuzzy` to match transaction descriptions that aren’t identical but are similar.
   ```python
   from fuzzywuzzy import fuzz

   def fuzzy_match_transactions(excel_df, api_df, threshold=80):
       matches = []
       unmatched_excel = excel_df.copy()
       unmatched_api = api_df.copy()

       for idx, excel_row in excel_df.iterrows():
           for api_idx, api_row in api_df.iterrows():
               if (excel_row['amount'] == api_row['amount']) and (fuzz.partial_ratio(str(excel_row['description']), str(api_row['description'])) > threshold):
                   matches.append((idx, api_idx))
                   unmatched_excel.drop(idx, inplace=True)
                   unmatched_api.drop(api_idx, inplace=True)
                   break

       return matches, unmatched_excel, unmatched_api
   ```

2. **Machine Learning for Anomaly Detection**:
   - Use machine learning models to detect unusual transactions that might require further investigation.

3. **Natural Language Processing (NLP) for Description Matching**:
   - Utilize NLP techniques to better understand and match transaction descriptions that might have variations or typos.
